task2: |
    Below is a set of IELTS Writing task 2 module topic and an answer. 
    {
        "question": {{.Question}},
        "answer": {{.Answer}},
        "wordCount": {{.WordCount}}
    }

    Evaluate the answer based on the following criteria, and provide a mark out of 9 as explained below, and give me the detailed review and notes on how to improve. Penalize for word count, since if it is below 250, it is highly unlikely that the person fully answered the topic. Penalize very harshly for the Task Response criterion, if the essay speaks about something completely different. If it is less, cut grades accordingly, as it is in real IELTS exam. Try to keep the result as low as possible, becuase nobody gets high on writing. Give 8 only to amazing essays, and 9 to perfect ones, which is really scarce:

    - Uses a variety of complex structures

    TASK RESPONSE (TR)
    Candidates are required to formulate and develop a position in relation to a given prompt in the form of a question or statement, using a minimum of 250 words. Ideas should be supported by evidence, and examples may be drawn from a candidate’s own experience.The TR criterion assesses:
    how fully the candidate responds to the task.
    how adequately the main ideas are extended and supported.
    how relevant the candidate’s ideas are to the task.
    how clearly the candidate opens the discourse, establishes their position and
    formulates conclusions.
    how appropriate the format of the response is to the task.COHERENCE AND COHESION (CC)
    This criterion is concerned with the overall organisation and logical development of
    the message: how the response organises and links information, ideas and language.
    Coherence refers to the linking of ideas through logical sequencing, while cohesion
    refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (e.g. logical connectors,
    conjunctions and pronouns) to assist in making clear the relationships between and
    within sentences.
    The CC criterion assesses:
    the coherence of the response via the logical organisation of information and/or ideas, or the logical progression of the argument.
    the appropriate use of paragraphing for topic organisation and presentation.
    the logical sequencing of ideas and/or information within and across paragraphs.
    the flexible use of reference and substitution (e.g. definite articles, pronouns).
    the appropriate use of discourse markers to clearly mark the stages in a response, e.g. [First of all | In conclusion], and to signal the relationship between ideas and/or information, e.g. [as a result | similarly].LEXICAL RESOURCE (LR)
    This criterion refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used and the accuracy and appropriacy of that use in terms of the specific task.
    The LR criterion assesses:
    the range of general words used (e.g. the use of synonyms to avoid repetition).
    the adequacy and appropriacy of the vocabulary (e.g. topic-specific items, indicators of writer’s attitude).
    the precision of word choice and expression.
    the control and use of collocations, idiomatic expressions and sophisticated phrasing.
    the density and communicative effect of errors in spelling.
    the density and communicative effect of errors in word formation.

    GRAMMATICAL RANGE AND ACCURACY (GRA)
    This criterion refers to the range and accurate use of the candidate’s grammatical resource via the candidate’s writing at sentence level.
    The GRA criterion assesses:
    the range and appropriacy of structures used in a given response (e.g. simple, compound and complex sentences).
    the accuracy of simple, compound and complex sentences.
    the density and communicative effect of grammatical errors.
    the accurate and appropriate use of punctuation.

    Although complex sentences are attempted, they tend to be faulty, and the greatest accuracy is achieved on simple sentences.
    Grammatical errors may be frequent and cause some difficulty for the reader.
    Punctuation may be faulty.

    BAND 4:Task Response:
    The prompt is tackled in a minimal way, or the answer is tangential, possibly due to some misunderstanding of the prompt.
    The format may be inappropriate.
    A position is discernible, but the reader has to read carefully to find it.
    Main ideas are difficult to identify, and such ideas that are identifiable may lack relevance, clarity, and/or support.

    There is minimal use of sequencers or cohesive devices. Those used do not necessarily indicate a logical relationship between ideas.
    There is difficulty in identifying referencing.
    Any attempts at paragraphing are unhelpful.
    Lexical Resource:
    The resource is inadequate (which may be due to the response being significantly underlength).
    Possible overdependence on input material or memorized language.
    Control of word choice and/or spelling is very limited, and errors predominate.
    These errors may severely impede meaning.
    Grammatical Range & Accuracy:
    Sentence forms are attempted, but errors in grammar and punctuation predominate (except in memorized phrases or those taken from the input material).
    This prevents most meaning from coming through.
    Length may be insufficient to provide evidence of control of sentence forms.

    BAND 2:Task Response:
    The content is barely related to the prompt.
